###Summary
The objective of this visualization is to look at the difference in survival based on sex across the diffrent classes. It is evident from the data that female passenges were prefered as compared to male passenges.

###Design
The use of scatter plot didn't convey the relation as strongly as I was expecting. Also, the visual were hard to understand at the first glance. So, it made sense to change to a comparative barplot.

###Feedback
The feedback that I received are as follows:
1. The data points were hard to find easily.
2. The male female difference was not easily visible and I was suggested to color code the variables.
3. There was not much happening in the chart. Having more detail would be good.
